pip install pandas

pip3 install pandas

When it comes to executing this project, there are two methods available:

1. Using the pre-extracted dataset that has already been saved in CSV format. This method is faster since it eliminates the need to extract tweets from the Twitter API, which can take a significant amount of time due to the 15-minute delay enforced by Twitter's API policy.

2. Extracting tweets from Twitter directly and disregarding any saved datasets.
